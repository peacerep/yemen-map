The "Visualizing Peace" project is a visual interface to the Peace Agreements Database (PA-X).  The interface categorizes peace agreements across three dimensions: time, location, and code (topics addressed in the agreements).  You can explore the agreements with interactive timeline and map data visualizations, selecting filters across the three dimensions to specify the types of agreements the data visualizations should display.  

At the top of the webpage, the horizontal timeline and map offer a way to study the chronology and geography of peace agreements simultaneously.  At the bottom of the webpage, the vertical timelines offer a way to compare the sequence of peace agreements in different countries.

The visual elements representing agreements in each visualization can be hovered or clicked in order to see more information about them on the left side of the webpage.  In the horizontal timeline, lines aligned either vertically or horizontally represent peace agreements.  In the map, flowers (with a minimum or zero and a maximum of seven petals) represent peace agreements.  Each flower petal corresponds to a code, all seven of which are listed in a clickable legend to the left of the map.  The larger the petal, the more detail an agreement  has on the relvant code.  In the vertical timelines, rectangles represent peace agreements.

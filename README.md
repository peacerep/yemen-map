# Visualizing Peace

A Data Visualization Project for the Political Settlements Research Programme (http://www.politicalsettlements.org/) at the University of Edinburgh.

Data Source: Peace Agreements Database (PA-X) - www.peaceagreements.org/search

The "Visualizing Peace" project is a visual interface to the Peace Agreements Database (PA-X).  The interface categorizes peace agreements across three dimensions: time, location, and code (topics addressed in the agreements).  You can explore the agreements with interactive timeline and map data visualizations, selecting filters across the three dimensions to specify the types of agreements the data visualizations should display.
